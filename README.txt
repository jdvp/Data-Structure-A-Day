What is this?

Since I am trying to get a job, I think it might be helpful to learn all of my data structures and algorithms again. I say again, but I'm sure there are fundamental structures and algorithms that I've never used before, such as tries (which I like the idea of but have never actually used).

This "challenge" (if you will) will not only force me to learn data structures (which is important in its own right), but also to implement the data structures in some meaningful way. For instance, if I am learning a trie, I would possibly implement a text document searching program. Each day, I will create a project which will use the data structure (or possibly algorithm) of the day!

Hopefully I learn a lot. For links to the individual projects (if you don't want to search through the repository manually), visit this project's page at jdvp.github.io/Data-Structure-A-Day
